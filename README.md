# solar-tracker
RPi code to track, record, and allow a user to access data from our home's solar system.

I had previously made a program to track and store data from my home's solar system onto a RPi 3, but the RPi 3 ended up overheating and was bricked. I believe I still have the data on the SD card, and I bought an RPi 5 with a cooling addon that should hopefully solve that problem. My current problem is that I had not been keeping track of how I made the project in the first place, and I am struggling to retrace my steps to get the code working on the RPi 5. I plan to actually keep the code updated here for if I or anyone else need to make updates in the future.
